        <description><![CDATA[description: <br>The third installation, The Garden of Stories by artist Yang Jie, is a kinetic sound installation made up of interactive sculptures crafted from everyday objects of kampung life in 1950s–60s Singapore. Featuring items like rubber seed charms, balancing scales and red wooden clogs, these mechanical vignettes come to life with movement and sound as visitors approach, evoking memories of the past. Set among trees in a plantation-like arrangement just outside Stamford Arts Centre, the installation invites audiences to wander, reflect, and connect with fragments of Singapore’s shared heritage through motion, sound, and storytelling. <br>  <br>About Yang Jie<br>  Yang Jie is a sculptor who draws inspiration from the intricate world of objects. From familiar household objects to industrial machines, he is fascinated by how things are made and used, excavating stories and ideas from found objects and machines through the traces of use. Using his background in electronics engineering and sculpture, he reinterprets the human experience through mechanical movements and electronics, transforming repaired and found objects into kinetic sculptures that perform. At the core of his exploration lies a fascination with how objects crafted by human hands of ten take on new and unexpected meanings beyond their original intentions. <br>  <br>Social Media<br> IG: @yj.sg (https://www.instagram.com/yj.sg/)<br>Dates: 22 Aug to 06 Sep<br>Time: <br>Venue: {'ItemId': '{E3D8B4F5-D1DB-42C9-B7EB-9C64ECABA366}', 'Value': 'Stamford Arts Centre', 'Address': 'Stamford Arts Centre'}<br>Admission: Free Admission<br>Artist: Yang Jie]]></description>

 About Adeline Kueh
 Adeline Kueh makes installations and socially embodied works that reconsider our relationships with objects and rituals. Using drawing as a conceptual tool, she maps historical trajectories with craft and oral tradition. As a co-founder of the Critical Craft Collective (Singapore) and the pan-Borneo Serumpun Collective, her artistic and curatorial research examines the entanglement of the elements of craft and the politics of care. A Senior Lecturer with LASALLE’s MA Fine Arts programme, Adeline has exhibited internationally, including World Architecture Festival, Venice Biennale, Hermes, NTU CCA IdeasFest, and Asia NOW. She is a 2024-2026 Ewha Womans University’s Global Fellow.

 Experience BBB’s storied past from 1 Aug – 6 Sep 2025 through seven light activations at landmarks such as the National Museum of Singapore (1 – 9 Aug), Reflection Pool @ Bras Basah MRT Station, Fortune Centre's digital billboard, Stamford Walkway, St. Joseph’s Church, Ten Square's digital billboard and The Cathay.

Through shifting visuals and playful lights, this piece evokes a time when these fragrant trees shaped the area's landscape and economy. 
 
 Can you catch that warm, fragrant hint of nutmeg in the air?
 
 About National Day Activations 
HeritageSG is proud to present the annual National Day Activations (NDAV), a national placemaking initiative held in the Bras Basah.Bugis (BBB) arts and heritage district. The NDAV is also held in conjunction with the Singapore Night Festival (SNF) 2025, to commemorate our nation's 60th birthday. Watch the precinct come to life through projections on historical buildings and activations at hidden spaces within BBB. 
 
 This year’s NDAV, Celebrating Our Island, celebrates 60 years of Singapore’s rich history – from food and nature to places and culture - and also pays tribute to the Singapore Night Festival. Aligned with this year’s festival theme, Island Nights, the activations will also highlight Sungei Beras Bassa, a historic river that once flowed through the plantations in the BBB precinct.
 
 Experience BBB’s storied past from 1 Aug – 6 Sep 2025 through seven light activations at landmarks such as the National Museum of Singapore (1 – 9 Aug), Reflection Pool @ Bras Basah MRT Station, Fortune Centre's digital billboard, Stamford Walkway, St. Joseph’s Church, Ten Square's digital billboard and The Cathay.

Her work is the culmination of a two-month residency at Objectifs. <br>A Sun-Dried Time Capsule is a reflection on the enduring charm of Waterloo Street and its stretch of sun-dry shops known for their dried produce and herbs. These goods resemble time capsules, with traces of history preserved in their shriveled skins and faded hues, shaped slowly by time, sunlight, and care. This series explores the imprint of time on form, space, and human connection; created using silver gelatin printing, each image is shaped by its reaction to different materials, durations, and sunlight exposures. It is both a quiet observation and a tribute to the sun-dried shops of Waterloo Street, and to the subtle forms that emerge when time, environment, and attentiveness converge. <br>Formerly from the Objectifs Young Photographers’ Mentorship Programme, Angelena will also conduct a workshop on Collage & Mark-Making. In this workshop, she invites participants to turn the every day into the extraordinary, blending the art of collage with the playful technique of mark-making to transform a simple envelope into a personal time capsule. <br>Participants will work with a curated set of images to craft a layered visual story, then experiment with natural, sun-dried materials to stamp and press unique textures onto their piece. Walk away with a one-of-a-kind keepsake that captures memories, moments, and a bit of magic. <br>Suitable for all ages and skill levels.

Following the screening, dive right into the post-screening creative activity and experiment with the art of water marbling – a tactile craft that echoes the themes of fluidity, reflection, and transformation explored in Where There’s Water.

        <name>Waterloo Street Stories: Familiar Strangers</name>
        <description><![CDATA[description: <br>  <br>An arts-led, community-engaged project about the embedded ecologies and intangible cultural heritage of the denizens of Waterloo Street. Amidst today’s climate of constant change and redevelopment, this project aims to bring to light to older and quieter neighbourhoods like Waterloo Street. In particular, this project aims to capture and celebrate the stories, interrelations and cultural heritage of the varied inhabitants who call Waterloo Street home. This project also hopes to inspire those less familiar with Waterloo Street to contemplate about the strangers in their own lives, and connect with the concept of a ‘familiar stranger’, a stranger who one nonetheless recognises from regular, sustained contact despite not forming a personal relationship. <br>  <br>a) ⁠Outdoor Photo Exhibition <br>Dates: Wed, 20 Aug to Sun, 7 Sep 2025<br> Venue: Back courtyard of Stamford Arts Centre <br>Set along the locale of Waterloo Street, this exhibition of staged self-portraits traces the residual presence of a city. During nightfall, the artist photographs himself as a speculative mid-century familiar stranger. The city becomes palimpsest, each image drawing the past into view through quiet acts of embodiment. Moving between visibility and disappearance, the work dwells where memory resists the forward march of development. It questions how a place holds its history, and how that history might be conjured—if only for a moment—before vanishing again. <br>  <br>b) Interactive Programme <br>Dates: Fri, 22 Aug & Sat, 23 Aug | Sat, 30 Aug & Sun, 31 Aug | Fri, 5 Sep & Sat, 6 Sep<br> Time: 6pm – 10.30pm<br> Venue: Stamford Arts Centre L1 Project Studio  Familiar Strangers is a participatory arts programme exploring the subtle and often overlooked fabric of social connections in our everyday lives. Through the showcasing of the myriad lived experiences of urban sociality embodied within Waterloo Street, a self-guided activity invites everyone to recall the familiar strangers in our lives – individuals we recognise but do not know – and co-create a community installation comprising a mosaic of stories that celebrates the significance of fleeting interactions in our lives.

Our core ethos revolves around the belief that "Dance is a strategy, and Malay is a concept." Through our creative endeavours, we navigate the intricate blend of tradition and contemporary practices. Our mission is twofold: to delve into moral complexities and to push the boundaries of tradition. At the heart of our approach lies a commitment to respect and reciprocity. By confronting moral dilemmas head-on, we aim to challenge entrenched traditions, fostering a space where new understandings can flourish.

Inspiration for this concept was drawn from staples such as retro diners, old-school shops, and infused with interactive stations to further liven the atmosphere.
