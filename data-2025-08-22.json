      "Content": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Kampong Chill</em> transcends a mere art installation; it's a profound, gentle rebellion against the relentless tyranny of schedules and the pervasive cult of \"busy-ness.\" This satirical piece champions inefficiency as an art form, elevates daydreaming to a cultural practice, and frames sitting still as a revolutionary act.</p>\n<p>It invites visitors to arrive without agenda and rest without guilt, using materials such as bamboo as a metaphor for brevity, to deconstruct myths that equate rest with laziness, slowness with failure, or wonder with wasted time. In the intense urban heart of Singapore, <em>Kampong Chill</em> offers a much-needed sanctuary for every citizen, migrant, and traveler: a place to pause, breathe, and rediscover oneself while remembering that everything is temporary and will eventually pass; so why not embrace the art of being truly present?

By transforming the street into a dreamscape of shared memories, it invites reflection on connection, heritage, and place, seamlessly blurring past and present in a vibrant celebration of urban life.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong></strong></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><br />\nProgrammes</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt;

Artist-driven and deeply progressive, Practice strives to be an arts space in Singapore that consciously nurtures and empowers people who care about humanity. Over the past 58 years, we have developed and presented works that aim to reflect the richness and complexities of Singapore&rsquo;s diverse cultures. Artistically diverse and constantly relevant, Practice will always engage in the ceaseless exploration of new frontiers.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Objectifs</strong> is a visual arts space in Singapore that is dedicated to film and photography. Our goal is to cultivate original voices in visual storytelling, and to inspire and broaden perspectives through the power of images. We do this by presenting a year round programme of exhibitions, screenings, workshops, talks, mentorships and residencies, aimed at fostering dialogue about visual culture, and advancing the practice and appreciation of photography and film.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>P7:1SMA</strong>, also referred to as Prisma, is a dance performance company helmed by Norhaizad Adam. Our core ethos revolves around the belief that \"Dance is a strategy, and Malay is a concept.\" Through our creative endeavors, we navigate the intricate blend of tradition and contemporary practices. Our mission is twofold: to delve into moral complexities and to push the boundaries of tradition. At the heart of our approach lies a commitment to respect and reciprocity. By confronting moral dilemmas head-on, we aim to challenge entrenched traditions, fostering a space where new understandings can flourish. Through our innovative works, we seek to reshape perceptions of Malay culture and identity, inviting audiences to explore new realms of thought and appreciation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Centre 42</strong> is a theatre development space committed to the creation, documentation and promotion of Singapore theatre, particularly in text-based works. We incubate original writings for the stage, support the development of artists and new works, and manage a functional archive documenting the histories and processes of Singapore theatre. Centre 42 is located at 42 Waterloo Street, and has called the Blue House its home since 2014. 2024 marks 10 years of Centre 42&rsquo;s contribution to this street.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>The Arts and Culture Management Programme at Singapore Management University (SMU-ACM)</strong> is a second major that provides an interdisciplinary blend of conceptual and skills-based learning to equip students with the foundational knowledge, managerial aptitude and strategic reflexivity for entry into the arts and creative industries. The hallmark strengths of ACM are the close linkages to the arts and cultural policy communities in Southeast Asia, and focus on experiential industry projects intended to sharpen the professional competencies and cultural leadership potential of students.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Social Media</strong><br />\nIG: <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thetheatrepractice/#\" target=\"_blank\">@thetheatrepractice</a> | <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/objectifscentre/#\" target=\"_blank\">@objectifscentre</a> | <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p71sma/#\" target=\"_blank\">@p71sma</a> | <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/centre42/#\" target=\"_blank\">@centre42</a> | <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/artsmgmtco/#\" target=\"_blank\">@artsmgmtco</a><br />\nFB:&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thetheatrepractice/\" target=\"_blank\">The Theatre Practice</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/objectifscentre\" target=\"_blank\">Objectifs</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/P71SMA/ \" target=\"_blank\">P7:1SMA</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Centre42/\" target=\"_blank\">Centre 42</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/artsmgmtco\" target=\"_blank\">SMU-ACM</a><br />\nWebsites:&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://practice.org.sg/\" target=\"_blank\">The Theatre Practice</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"www.objectifs.com.sg\" target=\"_blank\">Objectifs</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"www.p71sma.com\" target=\"_blank\">P7:1SMA</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"www.centre42.sg\">Centre 42</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://socsc.smu.edu.sg/sites/socsc.smu.edu.sg/files/socsc/pdf/programme/Programme%20structure_ACM_210920.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">SMU-ACM</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<br />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

These goods resemble time capsules, with traces of history preserved in their shriveled skins and faded hues, shaped slowly by time, sunlight, and care. This series explores the imprint of time on form, space, and human connection; created using silver gelatin printing, each image is shaped by its reaction to different materials, durations, and sunlight exposures. It is both a quiet observation and a tribute to the sun-dried shops of Waterloo Street, and to the subtle forms that emerge when time, environment, and attentiveness converge.</span></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.4px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 16.8667px;\">Formerly from the Objectifs Young Photographers&rsquo; Mentorship Programme, Angelena will also conduct a workshop on <em>Collage &amp; Mark-Making</em>.

Following the screening, dive right into the post-screening creative activity and experiment with the art of water marbling &ndash; a tactile craft that echoes the themes of fluidity, reflection, and transformation explored in Where There&rsquo;s Water.

This project also hopes to inspire those less familiar with Waterloo Street to contemplate about the strangers in their own lives, and connect with the concept of a &lsquo;familiar stranger&rsquo;, a stranger who one nonetheless recognises from regular, sustained contact despite not forming a personal relationship.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.4px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 16.8667px;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.4px;\"><span><span style=\"line-height: 16.8667px;\"><strong>a) </strong></span><strong><span style=\"line-height: 16.8667px;\">\u2060</span><span style=\"line-height: 16.8667px;\">Outdoor Photo Exhibition</span></strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.4px;\"><span><span style=\"line-height: 16.8667px;\">Dates: Wed, 20 Aug to Sun, 7 Sep 2025<br />\n</span>Venue: Back courtyard of Stamford Arts Centre</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.4px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 16.8667px;\">Set along the locale of Waterloo Street, this exhibition of staged self-portraits traces the residual presence of a city. During nightfall, the artist photographs himself as a speculative mid-century familiar stranger. The city becomes palimpsest, each image drawing the past into view through quiet acts of embodiment. Moving between visibility and disappearance, the work dwells where memory resists the forward march of development. It questions how a place holds its history, and how that history might be conjured&mdash;if only for a moment&mdash;before vanishing again.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.4px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 16.8667px;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.4px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 16.8667px;\"><strong>b) Interactive Programme</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.4px;\"><span><span style=\"line-height: 16.8667px;\">Dates: Fri, 22 Aug &amp; Sat, 23 Aug | Sat, 30 Aug &amp; Sun, 31 Aug | Fri, 5 Sep &amp; Sat, 6 Sep<br />\n</span>Time: 6pm &ndash; 10.30pm<br />\nVenue: Stamford Arts Centre L1 Project Studio&nbsp;</span></p>\n<span style=\"line-height: 16.8667px;\">Familiar Strangers is a participatory arts programme exploring the subtle and often overlooked fabric of social connections in our everyday lives. Through the showcasing of the myriad lived experiences of urban sociality embodied within Waterloo Street, a self-guided activity invites everyone to recall the familiar strangers in our lives &ndash; individuals we recognise but do not know &ndash; and co-create a community installation comprising a mosaic of stories that celebrates the significance of fleeting interactions in our lives. By encouraging dialogue and self-reflection, Familiar Strangers encourages participants to cultivate a heightened appreciation for, and curiosity about, the lives and perspectives of others around us.</span>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 16.8667px;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 16.8667px; text-decoration: underline;\">About SMU-ACM</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 16.8667px; color: #000000;\"></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 19.8pt 0cm 0cm; line-height: 17.6px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 14.6667px;\">The Arts and Culture Management Programme<strong> </strong>at Singapore Management University (SMU-ACM) is a second major that provides an interdisciplinary blend of conceptual and skills-based learning to equip students with the foundational knowledge, managerial aptitude and strategic reflexivity for entry into the arts and creative industries.

Installed in the former Tao Nan School, built in 1912, it holds one of the world&rsquo;s finest public collections of Peranakan objects. Three floors explore Peranakan life through themes related to origins, home, and style as aspects of identity. Community interviews, recorded demonstrations, art commissions, and other contemporary expressions of Peranakan culture provide a multi-faceted experience for visitors, encouraging them to ask themselves: \"what is Peranakan?\".<br />\n<br />\nThe museum is a department of ACM, operating under the National Heritage Board.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Social Media</strong><br />\nIG: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/peranakanmuseum/\">@peranakanmuseum</a><br />\nFB: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PeranakanMuseumSingapore/ \">facebook.com/PeranakanMuseumSingapore/</a><br />\nWebsite:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nhb.gov.sg/peranakanmuseum\">nhb.gov.sg/peranakanmuseum</a></p>",
